## About

In this project, we explore the application of machine learning algorithms to predict car prices. We use a dataset containing various features such as mileage, brand, year of production, engine type, and other relevant attributes to train and evaluate our models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [source name or link]. It consists of [number of instances] instances with [number of features] features. 

## Features

The features used for predicting car prices include:

- **Feature 1**: Description
- **Feature 2**: Description
- ...
- **Target Variable**: Selling price of the car

## Setup

To run the code in this repository, you need Python 3 and several libraries including numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the model and predict car prices, follow these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset.
2. **Training**: Train the machine learning model on the preprocessed data.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
4. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict car prices for new data.

Example usage:

```python
python train_model.py
```

## Model Evaluation

We evaluate the model based on the following metrics:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (R2) Score

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
